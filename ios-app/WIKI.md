## Overview

MyDay is a gamified family chore management iOS app. Children complete "quests" (chores) to earn XP and points, which they spend in a rewards shop. Parents manage chores, approve completions, post bounties (jobs), and configure household routines. The app uses a dark game theme with neon accents.

**47 Swift files** — SwiftUI, Observation framework, no third-party dependencies.

## Auth Flow

### Smart Auth — One Screen, Multiple Paths

The app uses a single `SmartAuthView` that replaces traditional role selection + separate login/register screens.

| Path | Taps | Who |
|------|------|-----|
| **Sign in with Apple** | 1-2 | Anyone |
| **Sign in with Google** | 1-2 | Anyone (pending SDK) |
| **Email login** | 3 | Returning users |
| **Email register** | 5 | New users (tap "New here?") |
| **Family code join** | 4 | Children / Parent 2 |
| **Kid exploring** | 4 | Child without code |
| **Biometric (Face ID)** | 1 | Returning users |

### How It Works

1. **No role selection** — the API profile response contains the role
2. **Login + Register on same screen** — "New here?" expands the name field inline
3. **"I have a family code"** — prominent link for children joining
4. **"I'm a kid exploring"** — kids register standalone, join family later
5. **Biometric** — saved credentials in Keychain with Face ID protection

### Routing Logic (MyDayApp.swift)

```
Loading → LaunchView
Not auth + has biometric creds → WelcomeBackView (Face ID)
Not auth → SmartAuthView
Auth + parent + no family → SetupFamilyFlow (inline onboarding)
Auth + child + no family → MainTabView (with join prompt)
Auth + has family → MainTabView
```
